Serial Slave Device DT binding

This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
attached devices. Common examples include Bluetooth, WiFi, NFC and GPS
devices.

qSerial attached devices shall be a child node of the host UART device the
slave device is attached to. It is expected that the attached device is
the only child node of the UART device. The slave device node name shall
reflect the generic type of device for the node.

Required Properties:

- compatible 	: A string reflecting the vendor and specific device the node
		  represents.

Optional Properties:

- reg		: A single cell representing the port/line number of the
		  host UART. Only used if the host UART is a single node
		  with multiple ports.

Example:

serial@1234 {
	compatible = "ns16550a";
	interrupts = <1>;

	bluetooth {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm43341-bt";
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <10>;
	};
};
